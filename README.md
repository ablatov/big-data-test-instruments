# big-data-test-instruments
The collection of utils methods for Big Data testing purposes

## Idea
The main idea is to create the large repository for Scala based integrations with REST API's of top used Big Data tools
like:
 - Yarn (https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html)
 - Marathon (https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/)
 - Consul (https://www.consul.io/)
 - Airflow (https://airflow.apache.org/)
 
 others...
